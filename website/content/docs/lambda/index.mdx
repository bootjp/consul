# AWS Lambda

You can register AWS Lambda functions in Consul and invoke them from mesh services.

Lambda functions are programs or scripts that run in AWS Lambda. The functions process events and return responses. Refer to the [AWS Lambda website](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) for additional information.

## Registering Lambdas

The first step toward invoking Lambdas from Consul is registering them as
Consul services. The [Registration
page](/docs/lambda/registration/overview) describes the process of
registering Lambdas at a high level along with explaining how to register
Lambdas with [Lambda registrator](/docs/lambda/registration/lambda-registrator)
and [manually](/docs/lambda/registration/manual).

## Invoking Lambdas

Lambdas can be invoked by any mesh service directly from connect proxies or
through terminating gateways. The [Invocation page](/docs/lambda/invocation)
explains how to invoke Lambdas from Consul connect services.
